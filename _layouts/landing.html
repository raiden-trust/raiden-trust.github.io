        The Raiden Trust manages the Raiden Network grant programme and its mission 
        is to strengthen and foster the greater Raiden ecosystem by supporting 
        projects and individuals working on complementary or foundational 
        components or applications that help to build and grow the Raiden Network. 
        The Raiden Trust is funded with 16 million RDN tokens.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        It is not involved with the core roadmap of the Raiden Network protocol, 
        but rather aims to support projects and individuals that wish to contribute 
        to the wider Raiden ecosystem. Projects will be supported via financial 
        means, guidance and the Raiden Trustâ€™s network in the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        The Raiden Trust was founded on 25th of April 2019 as an independent entity.
