        The Raiden Trust manages brainbot labs Establishment's Raiden Network grant 
        programme. It is funded with 16 million RDN tokens and its goal is to support 
        contributions to the wider Raiden ecosystem. <br> It is not involved with the core 
        roadmap of the Raiden Network protocol, but rather aims to support projects 
        and individuals that wish to contribute to the wider Raiden ecosystem.

        Projects will be supported via financial means, guidance and the Raiden
        Trustâ€™s network in the ecosystem.
