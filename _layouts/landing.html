        The Raiden Trust manages the Raiden Network grant programme and its mission 
        is to strengthen and foster the greater Raiden ecosystem by supporting 
        projects and individuals working on complementary or foundational 
        components or applications that help to build and grow the Raiden Network. 
        The Raiden Trust is funded with 16 million RDN tokens.

        means, guidance and the Raiden Trustâ€™s network in the ecosystem.
