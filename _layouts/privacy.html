      <p class="medium justify">
        This Privacy Policy describes how your Personal Information is
        collected, used, and shared by Raiden Trust. Personal
        Information means any information relating to an identified or
        identifiable natural person, who may be identified, directly or
        indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
        identification number, location data, online information (e.g. an IP
        address) or to one or more factors relating to that person. This notice
        applies to Personal Information provided to us by visitors to
        <a href="https://www.raidentrust.li/" target="_blank"
          >https://www.raidentrust.li/</a
        >
        (the “Site”), end users, beta testers, suppliers, contractors or
        applicants or other direct or indirect users or recipients of
        the functions we perform in running the Site.
        In this notice “you” refers to any individual whose Personal Information
        we hold or process.

        Personal Information we hold about you will be processed either because:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="justify">
          the processing is necessary in pursuit of a “legitimate interest”; a
          legitimate interest in this context means a valid interest we have or
          a third party has in processing your personal data which is not
          overridden by your interests in data privacy and security;
        </li>
        <li class="justify">
          you have consented to the processing for the specific purposes
          described in this notice; or

        automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” We may collect
        Device Information using the following technologies:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="justify">

      </h2>

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will not transfer any data in a systematic way outside of the EEA but
        there may be circumstances in which certain personal information is
        transferred outside of the EEA, in particular:
      </p>

      <ol>

        <li class="justify">
          we may have certain third-party service suppliers who are based
          outside the EEA or who store data outside of the EEA;

        provide the information on the Site or administer the Site or to enable
        us to comply with any statutory, legal or contractual obligation we may
        have. We review the Personal Information (and the categories of personal
        data) we are holding on a regular basis to ensure the data we are
        holding is still accurate and is still relevant to the Raiden Trust and its Site. If
        we discover that certain data we are holding is no longer necessary or
        accurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct or delete this data
        as may be required.

      <p class="medium justify">
        We will ensure that all contractors, staff or individuals engaged by us
        are aware of their privacy and data security obligations. We will take
        reasonable steps to ensure that the employees of third parties working
