            </h2>

            <p class="medium justify">
                The Raiden Trust’s mission is to strengthen and foster the greater Raiden ecosystem by supporting
                projects and individuals working on complementary or foundational components or applications that help
                to build and grow the Raiden Network.

                    <strong>Beneficial to the greater Raiden Network ecosystem</strong>

                        Raiden Network
                        ecosystem. This definition of eligible grant applications is purposely kept very broad to allow
                        for a wide range of projects. Projects supported could vary from someone contributing to an open
                        source library that the Raiden Network relies on to building a Raiden Network mobile wallet. It
                        also means that a grant application can be anything from a small side project to an effort
                        requiring several full-time employees.

            </h2>

            <h3 class="no-margin">Funding</h3>

            <p class="justify">The size of the grant depends on your requirements and budget projections. The maximum
                grant size is intended to not exceed $100,000. Receiving consecutive grants is possible depending on the
                progress of your project. </p>

            <h3 class="no-margin">Mentorship</h3>

            <p class="justify">Leverage the potential of your project through mentorship by providing you access to our
                network
                in the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, if you encounter technical problems a Raiden Network core
                developer may be able to help you. Or if you need a designer for your team, but don’t have the right
                contact we might be able to connect you with one.</p>

                The Raiden Trust is managed by the trustees of the Raiden Trust, who are supported by grant managers and
                an advisory board. If you want to learn more about our legal structure, read the legal launch blog post

                        This depends on various aspects such as grant size. It will be agreed upon before receiving
